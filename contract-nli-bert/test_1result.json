The closing of the Merger (the \u201cClosing\u201d) shall take place remotely via electronic exchange of required Closing documentation in lieu of an in-person Closing as soon as practicable, but no later than the third Business Day after the date the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waiver of such conditions by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefit thereof at the Closing) have been satisfied or, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, waived by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefit thereof, or at such other place, at such other time or on such other date as Parent and the Company may mutually agree (the date on which the Closing occurs, the \u201cClosing Date\u201d). \n\n\nSection 2.02          The Merger. \n\n\n(a)          At the Closing, (i) the Company shall file a certificate of merger (the \u201cCertificate of Merger\u201d) with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all other filings or recordings required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d) in connection with the Merger.  The Merger shall become effective at such time (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d) as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of State (or at such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and is specified in the Certificate of Merger). \n\n\n(b)          At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL (the \u201cMerger\u201d), whereupon the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the \u201cSurviving Corporation\u201d), such that immediately following the Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall be a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Holdings.  From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Sub, all as provided under the DGCL. \n\n\nSection 2.03          Conversion and Cancellation of Shares in the Merger.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of Company Common Stock, the common stock of Merger Sub: \n\n\n(a)          other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled or converted pursuant to Section 2.03(b) (the \u201cExcluded Shares\u201d), each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into, and shall thereafter represent only, the right to receive, 0.396 (the \u201cExchange Ratio\u201d) Parent ADSs (the \u201cMerger Consideration\u201d), subject to Section 2.08 with respect to fractional Parent ADSs, and immediately following such conversion, shall be automatically cancelled and cease to exist (the \u201cCancellation\u201d); 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b)          (i) each share of Company Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any such shares owned by Parent or Merger Sub in a fiduciary, representative or other capacity on behalf of other Persons, whether or not held in a separate account) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be paid with respect thereto and (ii) each share of Company Common Stock held by any wholly owned Subsidiary of either the Company or Parent (other than Merger Sub) immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into a number of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent ADSs equal to the Exchange Ratio; \n\n\n(c)          each share of common stock of Merger Sub, par value $0.01 per share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation; and \n\n\n(d)          all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and (i) each share of Company Common Stock that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented by a certificate (each, a \u201cCertificate\u201d) and (ii) each uncertificated share of Company Common Stock that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, was registered to a holder on the stock transfer books of the Company (an \u201cUncertificated Share\u201d) shall (in each case, other than with respect to Excluded Shares) thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the right to receive any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.04(f), to be issued or paid in accordance with Section 2.04, without interest. \n\n\nSection 2.04          Surrender and Payment. \n\n\n(a)          Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the \u201cExchange Agent\u201d) and enter into an exchange agent agreement with the Exchange Agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the \u201cExchange Agent Agreement\u201d) for the purpose of exchanging (i) Certificates or (ii) Uncertificated Shares for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock.  As of the Effective Time, in consideration of and in exchange for the Cancellation, Parent shall deposit with the ADS Depositary Parent Ordinary Shares underlying the Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to Section 2.03(a).  As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.04 through the Exchange Agent, the Parent ADSs issuable pursuant to Section 2.03(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.  For the avoidance of doubt, any stamp duty liability arising in connection with the deposit of Parent ADSs with the Exchange Agent will be payable by Parent.  Parent agrees to make available, directly or indirectly, to the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed additional cash sufficient to pay any dividends or other distributions to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.04(f).  Promptly after the Effective Time (and in no event later than five Business Days thereafter), Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of shares of Company Common Stock at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company and substantially finalized prior to the Effective Time and which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only on proper delivery of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.  All certificates (or evidence of Parent ADSs in book-entry form) and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be referred to in this Agreement as the \u201cExchange Fund\u201d.  Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be issued or paid pursuant to this Article II out of the Exchange Fund.  The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.  The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, that such cash shall only be invested in the manner provided in the Exchange Agent Agreement.  Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be the property of, and paid to, Parent on termination of the Exchange Fund. 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b)          Each holder of shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive, within five Business Days of the later to occur of (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, or (ii) receipt of an \u201cagent\u2019s message\u201d by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, the Merger Consideration in respect of each share of the Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate or Uncertificated Share (including any dividends and distributions with respect to the Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.04(f)).  The Parent ADSs constituting the Merger Consideration, at Parent\u2019s option, shall be in uncertificated book-entry form, unless a physical American depositary receipt evidencing such Parent ADSs is requested by a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or is otherwise required under Applicable Law. \n\n\n(c)          If any portion of the Merger Consideration (or any dividends and distributions with respect to the Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.04(f)) is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, transfer or similar Taxes required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax, transfer or similar Taxes have been paid or are not payable. \n\n\n(d)          From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company.  If, after the Effective Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration (and any dividends and distributions with respect to the Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.04(f)) with respect thereto in accordance with the procedures set forth in, or as otherwise contemplated by, this Article II (including this Section 2.04). 22\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(e)          Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of shares of Company Common Stock 12 months following the Closing Date shall be delivered to Parent or as otherwise instructed by Parent, and any such holder who has not exchanged shares of Company Common Stock for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Section 2.04 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration (and any dividends and distributions with respect to the Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.04(f)), without any interest thereon.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries) shall not be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any amounts properly paid to a public official in compliance with applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.  Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. \n\n\n(f)          Following the surrender of any Certificates, along with the delivery of a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal, or the transfer of any Uncertificated Shares, in each case as provided in this Section 2.04, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid, without interest, to the Person in whose name the Parent ADSs constituting the Merger Consideration have been registered, (i) in connection with the payment of the Merger Consideration, the aggregate amount of all dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such Parent ADSs, with a record date on or after the Effective Time that were paid prior to the time of such surrender or transfer, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date after the payment of the Merger Consideration, the amount of all dividends or other distributions payable with respect to whole Parent ADSs constituting the Merger Consideration with a record date on or after the Effective Time and prior to the time of such surrender or transfer and with a payment date subsequent to the time of such surrender or transfer.  No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent ADSs constituting the Merger Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any Certificates not surrendered or of any Uncertificated Shares not transferred until such Certificates are surrendered and the holder thereof delivers a properly completed and duly executed letter of transmittal or such or Uncertificated Shares are transferred, as the case may be, as provided in this Section 2.04. \n\n\nSection 2.05          Dissenters\u2019 Rights.  No dissenters\u2019 or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. \n\n\nSection 2.06          Company Equity Awards; Company Warrants. \n\n\n(a)          Company Stock Options.  At the Effective Time, each compensatory option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted under any Company Stock Plan that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a \u201cCompany Stock Option\u201d), whether or not vested shall, by virtue of the Merger and without further action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into an option to purchase Parent ADSs (each, an \u201cAssumed Stock Option\u201d), on the same terms and conditions (including any vesting or forfeiture provisions or repurchase rights, but taking into account any acceleration thereof provided for in the relevant Company Employee Plan or in the related award document by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby) as were applicable under such Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.  The number of Parent ADSs subject to each such Assumed Stock Option shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number of Parent ADSs, and such Assumed Stock Option shall have an exercise price per Parent ADS (rounded up to the nearest cent) equal to (A) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Company Stock Option divided by (B) the Exchange Ratio; provided, that in the case of any Company Stock Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies as of the Effective Time (taking into account the effect of any accelerated vesting thereof, if applicable) by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the Code, the exercise price, the number of Parent ADSs subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code; provided further, that in the case of any Company Stock Option to which Section 409A of the Code applies as of the Effective Time, the exercise price, the number of Parent ADSs subject to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code in order to avoid the imposition of any additional taxes thereunder. 23\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b)          Company Restricted Stock Units.  At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit award with respect to shares of Company Common Stock outstanding under any Company Stock Plan that vests solely based on the passage of time (each, a \u201cCompany RSU Award\u201d) shall be treated as set forth in this Section 2.06(b). \n\n\n(i)          To the extent a Company RSU Award becomes vested in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, pursuant to the terms of the applicable Company Employee Plan, restricted stock unit award agreement or other agreements between the Company and the award holder, a number of shares of Company Common Stock determined in accordance therewith will be issued to the award holder immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each such share will be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to the same conditions as, each share of Company Common Stock described in Section 2.03 above. \n\n\n(ii)          The Company shall take all necessary action to provide that each Company RSU Award that remains outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time after giving effect to Section 2.06(b)(i) above shall, effective as of the Effective Time, cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into a restricted stock unit award which shall represent the right to acquire Parent ADSs (each, an \u201cAssumed RSU Award\u201d), on the same terms and conditions (including any accelerated vesting on a termination of the holder\u2019s employment in connection with or following the Merger) as were applicable under such Company RSU Award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.  The number of Parent ADSs subject to each such Assumed RSU Award shall be equal to (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to each Company RSU Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded down, if necessary, to the nearest whole number of Parent ADSs. 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(c)          Board Actions.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company and of Parent (and/or the applicable committees thereof) shall adopt such resolutions as are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 2.06. \n\n\n(d)          Company ESPP.

such Company Acquisition Proposal or Company Inquiry and (ii) as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 48 hours after receipt) provide to Parent copies of any material written proposals, indications of interest or draft documentation (or, in the case of proposals or indications of interest delivered orally, shall provide to Parent a written summary of the material terms thereof)

communications relating to the terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition Proposal). \n\n\n(f)          Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Company Approval Time, in response to a bona fide Company Acquisition Proposal that has not resulted from a violation of this Section 6.03 that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Company Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company may, subject to compliance with this Section 6.03(f),

five Business Days before taking such action of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include an unredacted copy (if any) of the acquisition agreement and all other transaction documents relating thereto, (B) the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and its Representatives during such five Business Day notice period (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any adjustments proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (C) upon the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of the Company shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the adjusted terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent were to be given effect and (D) in the event of any change, from time to time, to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence each time (except that such notice period shall be reduced to two Business Days), during which time the Company shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.03(f) anew with respect to each such additional notice. \n\n\n(g)          Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Company Approval Time, subject to compliance with this Section 6.03(g), the Board of Directors of the Company may effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change in response or relating to a Company Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided, that (i) the Company shall first notify Parent in writing at least five Business Days before taking such action of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of such Company Intervening Event, (ii) during such five Business Day period following such notice, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent seeks to negotiate) regarding any adjustments proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company shall not effect any Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Company Intervening Event unless, after the five Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and taking into account any written commitment by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement during such five Business Day period, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. 78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 6.04          No Solicitation by Parent. \n\n\n(a)          Parent

all existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to or ongoing as of the date of this Agreement with respect to any actual or potential (including if such discussions or negotiations were for the purpose of soliciting any) Parent Acquisition Proposal or Parent Inquiry and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such Third Party (and any of

receipt of the Parent Shareholder Approval (the \u201cParent Approval Time\u201d), the Board of Directors of Parent receives a bona fide written Parent Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that has not resulted from a violation of this Section 6.04 and the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Parent Acquisition Proposal is or is reasonably likely to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal, and, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take the actions referred to in clause (A) and (B) below would be inconsistent with the directors\u2019 fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, then Parent may (A) subject to compliance with this Section 6.04, engage in negotiations or discussions with such Third Party and (B) furnish to such Third Party and its Representatives non- public information relating to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; provided, that all such non-public information (to the extent that such information has not been previously provided or made available to the Company) is

such action or disclosure that constitutes a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change shall be made only in compliance with the applicable provisions of this Section 6.04.  A \u201cstop, look and listen\u201d disclosure pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the 1934 Act shall not constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change. \n\n\n(e)          Parent shall notify the Company as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 48 hours) after receipt by Parent (or any of its Representatives) of any Parent Acquisition Proposal or any Parent Inquiry, which notice shall be provided in writing and shall identify the Third Party making, and the material terms and conditions of, any such Parent Acquisition Proposal or Parent Inquiry and include a copy of any written proposal, offer or draft agreement provided by such Person.  Parent shall thereafter (i) keep the Company informed, on a timely basis, of any material changes in the status and details (including of any amendment, development, discussion or negotiation) of any such Parent Acquisition Proposal or Parent Inquiry and (ii) as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than 48 hours after receipt) provide to the Company copies of any material proposals, indications of interest or draft documentation (or, in the case of proposals or indications of interest delivered orally, shall provide to the Company a written summary of the material terms thereof) relating to the terms and conditions of such Parent Acquisition Proposal or Parent Inquiry provided to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as written summaries of any material oral communications relating to the terms and conditions of any Parent Acquisition Proposal). 80\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(f)          Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Parent Approval Time, in response to a bona fide Parent Acquisition Proposal that has not resulted from a violation of this Section 6.04 that the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of Parent may, subject to compliance with this Section 6.04, (i) make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01(c)(iii); provided, that (A) Parent shall first notify the Company in writing at least five Business Days before taking such action of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include an unredacted copy (if any) of the acquisition agreement and all other transaction documents relating thereto, (B) Parent shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate with the Company and its Representatives during such five Business Day notice period (to the extent the Company seeks to negotiate) regarding any adjustments proposed by the Company to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, (C) upon the end of such notice period, the Board of Directors of Parent shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company, and shall have determined, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the Parent Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Parent Superior Proposal if the adjusted terms of the Agreement proposed by the Company were to be given effect and (D) in the event of any change, from time to time, to any of the financial terms or any other material terms of such Parent Superior Proposal, Parent shall, in each case, have delivered to the Company an additional notice consistent with that described in clause (A) of this proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence each time (except that such notice period shall be reduced to two Business Days), during which time Parent shall be required to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.04(f) anew with respect to each such additional notice. \n\n\n(g)          Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the Parent Approval Time, subject to compliance with this Section 6.04(g), the Board of Directors of Parent may effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response or relating to a Parent Intervening Event if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; provided, that (i) Parent shall first notify the Company in writing at least five Business Days before taking such action of its intention to take such action, which notice shall include a reasonably detailed description of such Parent Intervening Event, (ii) during such five Business Day period following such notice, Parent shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with the Company (to the extent the Company seeks to negotiate) regarding any adjustments proposed by the Company to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) the Board of Directors of Parent shall not effect any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change involving or relating to a Parent Intervening Event unless, after the five Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (ii), the Board of Directors of Parent determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel and taking into account any written commitment by the Company to amend the terms of this Agreement during such five Business Day period, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law. 81\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 6.05          Access to Information; Confidentiality. \n\n\n(a)          All information furnished pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of February 4, 2021 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time in accordance with its terms, the \u201cConfidentiality Agreement\u201d), between Parent and the Company. \n\n\n(b)          On reasonable notice, during normal business hours and subject to and consistent with Applicable Law, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement, in a manner so as to not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the other Party, each Party shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) afford to the other Party and its Representatives reasonable access to its properties, assets, books, contracts, personnel and records, (ii) furnish promptly to the other Party all other documents, materials and information concerning its businesses, properties and personnel as the other Party may reasonably request and (iii) instruct its pertinent Representatives to reasonably cooperate with the other Party in its review of any such information provided or made available.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent may not, without the prior written consent of the Company, postpone or adjourn the Parent Shareholder Meeting pursuant to clause (A)(1) or (B) of the immediately preceding sentence more than a total of two times and, on any single occasion, for a period of more than ten Business Days (unless, for a postponement or adjournment pursuant to clause (A)(2), as required by Applicable Law) or, if earlier, to a date that is after ten Business Days before the End Date.  Without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent shall not propose a vote by the shareholders of Parent at the Parent Shareholder Meeting on any matters that are inconsistent with or that would materially impede or delay the transactions contemplated hereby. \n\n\n(c)          Any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation Change notwithstanding, the obligations of the Company and Parent under Section 7.02 and this Section 7.03, including to call, give notice of and hold the Company Stockholder Meeting and the Parent Stockholder Meeting, shall continue in full force and effect unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Article IX. 89\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 7.04          Public Announcements.

The Parties shall prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with, and shall not take any position (whether on Tax Returns in Tax proceedings, or otherwise) inconsistent with such treatment unless required to do so pursuant to a \u201cdetermination\u201d within the meaning of Section 1313(a)(1) of the Code. The Parties adopt this Agreement as a \u201cplan of reorganization\u201d within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). \n\n\n(b)          Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts and shall cooperate with one another to obtain the Tax Opinion.  In connection with the foregoing, (x) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Tax Counsel a representation letter dated as of the Closing Date (and, if requested, dated as of the date on which the Form F-4 shall have been declared effective by the SEC or such other date(s) as determined necessary pursuant to consultations between counsel to Parent and counsel to the Company in connection with the filing of the Form F-4 or its exhibits or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) and signed by an officer of Parent containing appropriate representations determined to be necessary pursuant to consultations between counsel to Parent and counsel to the Company (the \u201cParent Tax Certificate\u201d), and (y) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to deliver to Tax Counsel a representation letter dated as of the Closing Date (and, if requested, dated as of the date on which the Form F-4 shall have been declared effective by the SEC or such other date(s) as determined necessary pursuant to consultations between counsel to Parent and counsel to the Company in connection with the filing of the Form F-4 or its exhibits or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus) and signed by an officer of the Company containing appropriate representations determined to be necessary pursuant to consultations between counsel to Parent and counsel to the Company (the \u201cCompany Tax Certificate\u201d).  To effectuate the obligations of Parent and the Company pursuant to the preceding sentence, each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to agree upon a form of the Parent Tax Certificate or the Company Tax Certificate, as applicable, within fifteen (15) days after the date of this Agreement. 90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(c)          The Parties shall cooperate to, and Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) comply with the reporting requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(6), (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with any \u201cfive-percent (5%) transferee shareholder\u201d of Parent within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii), who certifies to Parent in writing that it is such a shareholder and furnishes to Parent documentation reasonably satisfactory to Parent supporting such certification, to enable such Person to enter into a valid gain recognition agreement under Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8 with respect to the Merger, and (iii) make arrangements with each \u201cfive-percent (5%) transferee shareholder\u201d of Parent within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii), if any, to ensure that such shareholder will be informed of any disposition of any property that would require the recognition of gain under such person\u2019s gain recognition agreement entered into under Treasury Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8. \n\n\n(d)          The Company shall deliver to Parent at the Closing a properly executed and completed certification, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, and that meets the requirements of Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h), dated not more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date and signed by an executive officer of the Company, certifying that no interest in the Company is, or has been during the relevant period specified in Section

Internal Revenue Service regarding such certification, prepared in accordance with the provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h)(2). \n\n\n(e) \n\n\n(i)          If a Tax Law Change has occurred, each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate in good faith with the other Party to restructure the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the composition of the Merger Consideration) in a manner so that the Parties reasonably determine in good faith (after consultation with counsel to Parent and counsel to the Company) that Parent would not be treated as a Domestic Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as so restructured. \n\n\n(ii)          If the Parties agree upon a restructuring described in Section 7.05(e)(i), then, the Parties shall enter into an appropriate amendment to this Agreement to reflect such restructuring and shall cooperate to provide for such other changes as may be necessitated by such restructuring. 91\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(iii)          For the avoidance of doubt, any actions taken pursuant to this Section 7.05(e) shall not (i) alter the economic value of the Merger Consideration (determined without regard to any taxable gain recognized by each holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 356(a) of the Code and Treasury Regulations Section 1.356-1(b)), (ii) prevent or impede the Merger and the Contribution (if the Contribution occurs) from qualifying for the Intended Tax Treatment, (iii) cause the stockholders of the Company (other than any Excepted Stockholder) to recognize gain pursuant to Section 367(a)(1) of the Code, (iv) impose any material economic or other costs on Parent or the Company, or (v) materially delay the consummation of the Merger (other than as is required for any approval of such restructured transaction as mutually agreed by Parent and the Company), in the case of each of clauses (Y)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v), without the consent of each of the Company and Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. \n\n\nSection 7.06          Employee Matters. \n\n\n(a)          From the Closing Date through the date that is 12 months following the Closing Date (the \u201cBenefits Continuation Period\u201d), the Surviving Corporation shall provide, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, to each individual who is employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, while such individual continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of Parent\u2019s Subsidiaries (including Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation) during the Benefits Continuation Period (collectively, the \u201cAffected Employees\u201d) (i) a base salary or wage rate that is not less than the base salary or wage rate provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) target annual bonus and commission opportunities that are no less favorable than as provided to such Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (iii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the employee benefits provided to either, as determined by Parent, (A) such Affected Employee under the Company Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time or (B) the employee benefits provided by Parent to its similarly-situated employees; provided, however, that no retention, change-in control or other special or non-recurring compensation or benefits provided prior to the Effective Time or any equity or other long-term incentives, defined benefit pension plans or post-employment welfare benefits shall be taken into account for purposes of this covenant. \n\n\n(b)          With respect to any employee benefit plan in which any Affected Employee first becomes eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time (the \u201cNew Company Plans\u201d), Parent shall: (i) use commercially reasonable efforts to waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to such Affected Employee under any New Company Plan that is a health or welfare plan in which such Affected Employee may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time to the extent satisfied or waived under a comparable Company Employee Plan, (ii) recognize service of Affected Employees (to the extent credited by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in any comparable Company Employee Plan) accrued prior to the Effective Time for all purposes under (but not for the purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) any New Company Plan in which such Affected Employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, provided, however, that in no event shall any credit be given to the extent it would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of service, and (iii) if applicable, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be credited, in any New Company Plan that is a health plan in which Affected Employees participate, any deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Affected Employee and such Affected Employee\u2019s beneficiaries and dependents during the portion of the calendar year in which such Affected Employee first becomes eligible for the New Company Plan that occurs prior to such Affected Employee\u2019s commencement of participation in such New Company Plan with the objective that there be no double counting during the first year of eligibility of such deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses. 92\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(c)          Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Merger constitutes a \u201cchange of control\u201d, a \u201cchange in control\u201d or a \u201csale event\u201d (or a term of similar import) for purposes of any Company Employee Plan set forth on Section 4.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule that contains a definition of \u201cchange of control\u201d, a \u201cchange in control\u201d or a \u201csale event\u201d (or a term of similar import), as applicable; provided, however, that neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby shall result in any \u201csingle trigger\u201d vesting of any equity awards granted by the Company.  Parent further agrees, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any applicable Subsidiary, to honor and abide by the terms of any severance and change in control plans, agreements and arrangements for the benefit of the Affected Employees that are in effect and have been listed on Section 4.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, unless otherwise agreed to between the applicable Affected Employee and Parent. \n\n\n(d)          Nothing contained in this Section 7.06 or elsewhere in this Agreement, express or implied (i) shall cause either Parent or any of its Affiliates to be obligated to continue to employ any Person, including any Affected Employees, for any period of time following the Effective Time, (ii) shall prevent Parent or its Affiliates from revising, amending or terminating any Company Employee Plan, Parent Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or policy in effect from time to time, (iii) shall be construed as an amendment of any Company Employee Plan, Parent Employee Plan or any other employee benefit plan, program or policy in effect from time to time, or (iv) shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any director, officer, employee or individual Person, including any present or former employee, officer, director or individual independent contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent of such individual). \n\n\nSection 7.07          Section 16 Matters.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under Applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the 1934 Act. \n\n\nSection 7.08          Stock Exchange Delisting.

Each of Parent and Merger Sub and the Company shall (a) take all action necessary so that no Takeover Law, or any similar provision of the Company Organizational Documents or the Parent Organizational Documents, as applicable, is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) if any such anti-takeover law, regulation or provision is or becomes applicable to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, cooperate and grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby. \n\n\nSection 7.11          Transaction Litigation. \n\n\n(a)          Subject to Applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of (i) any notice or other communication received from a Governmental Authority, subject to Section 7.01(d) and (ii) any stockholder or shareholder demands or other Actions (including derivative claims) commenced against it, any of its Subsidiaries and/or its or any of its Subsidiaries\u2019 respective directors or officers relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters relating thereto (collectively, \u201cTransaction Litigation\u201d). \n\n\n(b)          Subject to Applicable Law and to the extent that the attorney-client privilege is not compromised or otherwise adversely affected, each of the Company and Parent shall keep the other Party informed regarding any Transaction Litigation (including by promptly furnishing to the other Party and such other Party\u2019s Representatives such information relating to such Transaction Litigation as may reasonably be requested).  Subject to Applicable Law and to the extent that the attorney-client privilege is not compromised or otherwise adversely affected, each Party shall (i) reasonably cooperate with the other in the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation, (ii) give the other Party the opportunity to consult with it regarding the defense and settlement of such Transaction Litigation (and consider in good faith the other Party\u2019s advice with respect to such Transaction Litigation) and (iii) give the other Party the opportunity to participate (at the other Party\u2019s expense) in (but not control) the defense and settlement of such Transaction Litigation.

Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly notify the other of any change, condition or event (a) that renders or would reasonably be expected to render any representation or warranty of such Party set forth in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate or (b) that results or would reasonably be expected to result in any failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement, in each case of clause (a) or clause (b), such that any of the conditions to the Merger set forth in Article VIII could reasonably be expected to not be satisfied; provided, however, that no such notification shall affect any of the representations, warranties, covenants, rights or remedies, or the conditions to the obligations of, the Parties hereunder. \n\n\nSection 7.13          Director and Officer Liability. \n\n\n(a)          From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) in each case to the fullest extent permissible by applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the Company or of a Subsidiary of the Company (each, an \u201cIndemnitee\u201d and, collectively, the \u201cIndemnitees\u201d) with respect to all claims, liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Action based on or arising out of (A) the fact that an Indemnitee is or was a director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitee\u2019s capacity as a director or officer of the Company or such Subsidiary or taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in connection with serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a representative of another Person (including any employee benefit plan)), in each case of clauses (A) and (B), at, or at any time prior to, the Effective Time (including any Action relating in whole or in part to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and (ii) assume (in the case of the Surviving Corporation, in the Merger without any further action) all obligations of the Company and such Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time as provided in the Company Organizational Documents and the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement or in the agreements in effect as of the date of this Agreement providing for indemnification between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnitee.  Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause, unless otherwise required by Law, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to limitation of liabilities of directors and officers and indemnification than are in the Company Organizational Documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnitees.  In addition, from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal counsel) of any Indemnitee under this Section 7.13 as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law; provided that the Indemnitee to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnitee was not entitled to indemnification under this Section 7.13. 95\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b)          Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees shall cooperate to the extent reasonably practicable in the defense of any claim and shall provide access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. \n\n\n(c)          For the six-year period commencing immediately after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect the Company\u2019s current directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those individuals who are covered by the Company\u2019s directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance policies on terms and scope with respect to such coverage, and in amount, no less favorable to such individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement (or Parent may substitute therefor policies, issued by reputable insurers, of at least the same coverage with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, including a \u201ctail\u201d policy); provided that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in any one year an amount in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual amounts currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such insurance (such amount being the \u201cMaximum Premium\u201d).  The Company shall have the right prior to the Effective Time to purchase a six-year prepaid \u201ctail policy\u201d on terms and conditions providing at least substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time, covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby, so long as the effective annual premium under such policy does not exceed the Maximum Premium.  If such prepaid \u201ctail policy\u201d has been obtained by the Company, it shall be deemed to satisfy all obligations to obtain insurance pursuant to this Section 7.13 and the Surviving Corporation shall cause such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and to honor all of its obligations thereunder. \n\n\n(d)          The provisions of this Section 7.13 are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such individual may have under the Company Organizational Documents, by contract or otherwise.  The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section 7.13 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom this Section 7.13 applies unless (x) such termination or modification is required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented in writing to such termination or modification.  The Indemnitees to whom this Section 7.13 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 7.13. The Surviving Corporation agrees to (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) pay or advance, upon written request of the Indemnitee, all costs, fees and expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, that may be incurred by the Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and other rights provided in this Section 7.13; provided that the Indemnitee to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnitee was not entitled to indemnification under this Section 7.13. 96\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(e)          If any of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving company, partnership or other Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.13. \n\n\n(f)          Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors or officers, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this Section 7.13 is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such policies. \n\n\nSection 7.14          Obligations of Merger Sub.  (a) Until the Effective Time, Holdings shall at all times be the direct owner of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Merger Sub.  Parent shall take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.  Promptly following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall cause Holdings, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, to execute a written consent approving and adopting this Agreement in accordance with Applicable Law. \n\n\nSection 7.15          Transition Committee.

The Parties hereto further agree that disclosure of any item, matter or event in any particular section or subsection of either the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Parent Disclosure Schedule, as applicable, to which the relevance of such disclosure would be reasonably apparent, notwithstanding the omission of a cross-reference to such other section or subsections. 107\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\n(b)          The Parties hereto agree that in no event shall any disclosure contained in any part of any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d, \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d, \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d or \u201cNote Regarding Forward Looking Statements\u201d or any other disclosures in any Company SEC Document or Parent SEC Document that are cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature be deemed to be an exception to (or a disclosure for purposes of or otherwise qualify) any representations and warranties of any Party contained in this Agreement. \n\n\nSection 10.06          Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment. \n\n\n(a)          The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure solely to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except, from and after the Effective Time, for the rights of the Indemnitees as provided in Section 7.13. \n\n\n(b)          No Party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each other Party hereto, except that any of Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to one or more of its Affiliates at any time, in which case all references herein to Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, shall be deemed references to such other Affiliate, except that all representations and warranties made herein with respect to Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed to be representations and warranties made with respect to such other Affiliate as of the date of such assignment. \n\n\nSection 10.07          Governing Law.  This Agreement, and all disputes, claims, actions, suits or proceedings based upon, arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to the conflicts of law rules or principles that would result in the application of the law of any other state. \n\n\nSection 10.08          Jurisdiction/Venue.

Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect of its property to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts.  Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any claim that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.  To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, each of the Parties hereto hereby consents to the service of process in accordance with Section 10.01; provided, that nothing herein shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law. 108\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 10.09          WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.  EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (C) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (D) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.09. \n\n\nSection 10.10          Counterparts; Effectiveness.  This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, including by facsimile, by email with .pdf attachments, or by other electronic signatures (including DocuSign and AdobeSign), each of which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.  This Agreement shall become effective when each Party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof signed and delivered (by electronic communication, facsimile or otherwise) by all of the other Parties hereto.  Until and unless each Party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other Party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect, and no Party shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other communication). \n\n\nSection 10.11          Entire Agreement.  This Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Voting Agreement and the Parent Voting Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter thereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter thereof. 109\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nSection 10.12          Severability.  If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party.  Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible. \n\n\nSection 10.13          Specific Performance.  The Parties\u2019 rights in this Section 10.13 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable harm would occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law (a) for any breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or (b) in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms.  It is accordingly agreed that (except where this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 9.01) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages, and each Party further agrees to waive any requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy.  The right to specific performance hereunder shall include the right of a Party to cause the Merger to be consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.  The Parties further agree that (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this Section 10.13, a Party shall not in any respect waive its right to any other form of relief that may be available to a Party under this Agreement, nor shall the commencement of any action pursuant to this Section 10.13 or anything contained in this Section 10.13 restrict or limit any Party\u2019s right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Section 9.01 or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.  In no event shall the Company or Parent be entitled to both (i) specific performance to cause the other Party to consummate the Closing and (ii) the payment of the Parent Termination Payment or the Company Termination Payment, as applicable. \n\n\n{Remainder of page intentionally left blank; signature page follows} 110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n________________\n\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized officers as of the date first written above. \n\n\n AMRYT PHARMA PLC       By: /s/ Dr. Joe Wiley   Name: Dr. Joe Wiley   Title: Chief Executive Officer       ACORN MERGER SUB, INC.
